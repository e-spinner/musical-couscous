# Architecture

Desktop planning app for a rolling 2-week sprint. Electron hosts the UI, a local Flask server handles schedule generation, and the frontend is built with plain HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## Stack

- Electron desktop shell
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Python Flask backend
- Local storage for tasks, availability, and the latest generated schedule
- Codex 5.4 for AI-assisted development

## Current App Flow

The app is split into three pages:

- `Dashboard`: shows today's timeline, the queue, blocked time, the 2-week calendar, task editing, and the day review flow
- `Schedule Refiner`: captures blocked and available time across the next 2 weeks
- `Task Scheduling`: provides the full task board and auto-runs optimization in the background

## Project Structure

See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for file-by-file documentation.

## Requirements

Install these first:

- `Python 3.11` recommended for local development
- `Node.js 18+` recommended
- `npm`

The backend scheduler currently uses Google's OR-Tools `CP-SAT` solver through the `ortools` package in `backend/requirements.txt`.

## Full Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.11

Install Python `3.11` first, then confirm your shell is picking up that version:

```powershell
python --version
```

You should see a `Python 3.11.x` result before continuing.

If your machine has multiple Python installs and `python` points at the wrong one, use the Windows launcher instead:

```powershell
py -3.11 --version
```

### 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

From the project root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it in shell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you are using Command Prompt instead:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

If you are using Git Bash instead:

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

If you need to force the venv to use Python `3.11`, create it with:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Install backend dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r .\backend\requirements.txt
```

This installs Flask plus OR-Tools, which provides the `CP-SAT` optimizer used by the scheduler backend.

### 4. Install Electron dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

### 5. Build the Windows backend executable

For Windows packaging, build the Flask backend with PyInstaller before running Electron Builder:

```powershell
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller .\architecture-backend.spec
```

This should produce `dist\architecture-backend\architecture-backend.exe`.

## Running The App

### Recommended: run the desktop app

With `.venv` created in the project root, Electron will automatically use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for the backend in development.

Keep the virtual environment active, then run:

```powershell
npm start
```

Electron will launch and automatically start the Flask server on `http://127.0.0.1:5050`.

### Optional: run the backend by itself for testing

With the virtual environment active:

```powershell
python .\backend\server.py
```

Then open the Electron app in a separate terminal with:

```powershell
npm start
```

## Running Tests

### Run the backend test suite

With the virtual environment active:

```powershell
python .\backend\run_tests.py
```

This discovers and runs all `test_*.py` files under `backend/`.

### Run a single backend test file

```powershell
python .\backend\test_server.py
```

### Optional smoke benchmark

```powershell
python .\backend\smoke_benchmark.py
```

## Development Notes

- The backend is started by Electron from `backend/server.py`
- In development, `npm start` will use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` if that local virtual environment exists
- Tasks, availability, and the latest merged schedule are stored in browser local storage
- The task board and dashboard can both edit tasks
- The task board automatically re-optimizes in the background after task changes
- The dashboard can also update tasks and rerun scheduling after modal edits
- Saving the schedule refiner also reruns optimization in the background when tasks already exist
- The task board includes a `Debug Reset` button that clears all saved tasks and the saved schedule state

## Data Model

Tasks are stored locally and currently support:

- `title`
- `estimateMinutes`
- `dueDate`
- `status`: `new`, `in_progress`, `completed`
- `priority`: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `cognitiveLoad`: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `notes`

Availability is stored as a 14-day schedule plus weekly routine overrides. The last generated schedule is also stored locally so past scheduled items can remain visible while future time is re-optimized.

## Scheduler Behavior

The scheduler currently:

- sorts tasks by earliest due date first
- treats due dates as `00:01` on the due date
- only schedules into future availability starting from the next half hour
- preserves already-past scheduled segments when a new plan is generated
- keeps the 60-minute minimum segment rule for tasks that need 60 minutes or more
- allows tasks under 60 minutes to use a shorter slot if the whole task itself is under 60 minutes
- leaves leftover time unscheduled if there is not enough time for the task's minimum valid segment
- exits cleanly when there are no remaining schedulable tasks instead of treating that state as an optimizer failure

## Optimizer Notes

- The backend scheduler is implemented in `backend/server.py` and uses OR-Tools `CP-SAT`.
- Successful schedule responses currently report the solver as `python-cp-sat` or `python-cp-sat-timeboxed`.
- If the backend starts but scheduling fails immediately with an import error, the usual cause is that the venv is missing `ortools` or was created with the wrong Python install.
- Tasks due within the next `2 days` may ignore the normal cognitive-load max segment cap as an emergency overload rule, while still respecting the `60-minute` minimum block and `15-minute` alignment rules.

## Python Optimizer Contract

The Flask backend accepts a `POST` request at `/api/schedule`.

```

### Segment Field Meaning

- `blockStart` and `blockEnd`: the full availability window the frontend sent to the optimizer
- `start` and `end`: the portion of that availability window actually assigned to the task

### Output Fields

- `summary`: scheduling totals for the current run
- `schedule`: tasks that were fully placed
- `schedule[].segments`: one or more assigned working windows
- `segments[].allocatedMinutes`: minutes assigned in that segment
- `unscheduled`: tasks that could not be fully placed
- `unscheduled[].missingMinutes`: time still needing a valid slot

## Dashboard Review Flow

- after `8:00 PM` local time, a review banner can appear for today's scheduled tasks
- the header also includes a `Test Review` button so the banner can be forced open during testing
- tasks worked on today can be auto-marked `In Progress` in review
- if today's worked time reduces a task to `0 min left`, review can auto-mark it `Completed`
- those auto-defaults are highlighted so the user can still change them before saving

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm start` fails because Electron dependencies are missing, run `npm install` again from the project root.
- If Python packages are missing, reactivate the virtual environment and run `python -m pip install -r .\backend\requirements.txt` again.
- If `python --version` is not `3.11.x`, recreate the virtual environment with `py -3.11 -m venv .venv` so the backend and `ortools` install against the intended interpreter.
- If scheduling fails because `ortools` or `cp_model` cannot be imported, confirm the venv is active and reinstall backend dependencies with `python -m pip install -r .\backend\requirements.txt`.
- If the packaged Windows app says the Flask backend stopped unexpectedly on launch, rebuild the backend with `pyinstaller .\architecture-backend.spec` and confirm `dist\architecture-backend\architecture-backend.exe` exists before running `npm run build:win-portable`.
- If `Schedule Refiner` says optimization failed, check the inline message under `Save Schedule` and the Electron terminal output. The Flask backend now logs the count of blocks/tasks received for each scheduling request.
- If PowerShell blocks venv activation, run PowerShell as your user and use:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

## GitHub Publishing Notes

The repository is set up to ignore local-only files such as:

- `node_modules/`
- `.venv/`
- Python cache files
- build output and log files

## Known Edge Cases To Test

- a free `30-minute` slot should not receive a scheduled task segment for a `60+ minute` task
- a task that is itself under `60 minutes` can use a matching short slot
- if the current time is mid-day, earlier parts of the day should not be newly scheduled
- blocked time from the refiner should appear on the dashboard
- completed tasks should clear automatically once their due date time threshold passes
